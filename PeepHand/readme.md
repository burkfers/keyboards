# PeepHand


a one hand gaming board to the exact specifications of Mrs. burkfers. Note the unusual key well: There's two pinky cols and only one index col.
The joystick is fully analog and can do WASD emulation  for games that don't support mixing input schemes (sadly too many).
The hand rest is dovetailed into the bottom plate and secures with one screw.
Battle-tested for several weeks now, wife is happy.
